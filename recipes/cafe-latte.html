                <li>Milk of your choice <small>(it better be oatmilk)</small></li>
            </ul>
        <h2>You will need an espresso machine so figure that out</h2>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Weigh out your beans if you haven't and grind them on a fine setting into your portafilter.</li>
                <li>Distribute the ground coffee to remove any clumps.</li>
                <li>Tamp down the coffee with reasonable pressure, you want a perfectly flat surface.</li>
                <li>Lock into your espresso machine and brew, we aim for 36 grams of espresso in ~20-30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Steam your milk until barely too hot to touch.</li>
                <li>At this point you can add flavor or just the milk, but thats it!</li>
            </ol>
